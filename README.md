## How to use
1. Download the script file in this repository (files_names_string.py)
2. Open a terminal (or Python shell) and run the script in a Python shell
     (e.g. on a Windows Command Prompt, you would run `python files_names_string.py`)
3. Follow the prompts. There is (naive) data validation for these prompts, but quit and restart the script if you make an incorrect input and the script accepts it.

### Execution flow
1. The script will ask for the absolute path of the directory on your system that you want to scan. This input is **not** validated, and will scan whatever you input.
2. The directory will be scanned and create a set out of the file extensions present (and directories, if there are any subdirectories). This set will be presented to you so you know what is present and can answer the next question.
3. The script will ask if you want to exclude any file types. You can only enter `Y` or `N` to continue.
4. If you responded with a `Y`, you will type each extension/file type that you want to exclude, one at a time. If your input is not in the set of compiled file extensions present in the directory, or is not the word `Directory` or `Done`, it will be rejected and re-prompt you. The script will not advance until you've entered `Done`, then will tell you what is being excluded.
5. The script will ask if you want the string to be composed of the file names without their extensions. For example, a file with the name `example.txt` would be added to the result string as `example` if you said yes to this option.
6. The string will be composed and printed, and the script's execution will end.

### Considerations for future development
* Turn this into a shell command with the options present here as flag args that the user would be able to use and specify at will (instead of forcing every user into a sequence of yes or no questions)
* Add the option to pipe the output of the string into a text file as specified by the user
* Add extra shell graphics to distinctify the various steps and output of the script
